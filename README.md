# 8376
This project involves exploratory data analysis, data modeling, and visualization for a financial dataset. The components include:
1.	EDA_Operation_3.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) operations.
2.	data_model.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data modeling process.
3.	TeleBank.pbix: A Power BI file used for advanced visualizations.
Files Description
1. EDA_Operation_3.ipynb
This notebook focuses on:
•	Analyzing the dataset for patterns and insights.
•	Preparing data for modeling and visualization purposes.
2. data_model.ipynb
This notebook covers:
•	Constructing a data model based on the findings from the EDA.
•	Implementing preprocessing steps to enhance data quality.
•	Features engineering and validation to improve model performance.
3. TeleBank.pbix
This Power BI file includes:
•	Interactive dashboards for visualizing key insights.
•	Detailed reports on financial data trends.
•	Insights related to the companies identified in the EDA phase.
Usage
1.	Open the EDA_Operation_3.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore and analyze the dataset.
2.	Use the data_model.ipynb notebook to implement data modeling tasks and preprocess the data further.
3.	Visualize insights and reports using the TeleBank.pbix file in Microsoft Power BI.
Requirements
•	Python (with Jupyter Notebook) installed.
•	Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn (exact dependencies may vary based on the notebooks).
•	Microsoft Power BI Desktop for viewing and editing the .pbix file.
